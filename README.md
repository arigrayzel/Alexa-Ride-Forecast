# Alexa-Ride-Forecast

POWERED BY DARK SKY API

Have you ever been getting ready to go for a ride and you want to know what the weather is but it is too much of a hassle to open the weather app on your phone?
Does your weather app not give you pertinent information like wind speed and direction?
Now with Bike Tool, you can get all of this with just the power of your voice!

The included file is the lambda code for the Amazon Lambda function. The Alexa interaction model is fairly simple to build, it just needs a "forecastIntent" with some appropriate utterances.
